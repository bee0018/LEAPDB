# LEAP Database Administration

This solution allows for teachers and parent users to see the full scope of their students progress. The users will interact with
a database that will help them carry out the numerous tasks that will help optimize student performance. 

## Abstract

Many schools were shut down as a means to contain the spread of the COVID-19 virus, however, this led to a rapid decline in enrollment
for grades K-12, and even the completion of assigned educational assessments. LEAP is designed to accelerate student learning for grades
K-12 through an engaging, yet interactive mathematical web application.

## Getting Started

### Installing

Hardware Requirements
* Laptop/Desktop

Software Requirements
* .NET / C#
* React.js
* Node.js
* Database: SQL Server Express (preferred)
* Web Browser
* Git Client (Gitkraken preferred)
* Visual Studio (preferred 2022)

### Interface Metaphor: Web Application
LEAP is implemented as a web application that will prompt its user to indicate which grade level they wish to study, 
provide questions and answers, and even keep scores across the different levels. 

### Interaction Style: Combination
LEAP utilizes several different interaction styles; namely, graphical direct manipulation, 
menu selection, form fill-in, and function keys.​

## Scenarios
Teachers using the LEAP website application will be able to streamline math development for their K-12 students and provide an exciting, new way to do math. Teacher wants to help bridge the gap 
between her COVID-19 affected students and any math deficiencies. 
* ​The system could add modules and activities to the application
* The system can add students and setup their subjects, modules, and activities
* ​The system would allow for the teacher to add parents' information to the system and link the student/parent together

The parents of the students will be able to fully review the student’s progress in a simple way. The parents would like to be knowledgeable of their student’s performance and wants to be in communication 
with the teacher if anything is wrong.
* The system will allow for the parents to email the parents of their student
* The system will produce a student report and send their performance to the parent
* The system will allow for the parents to review and interact with student’s record
